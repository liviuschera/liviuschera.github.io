        "As a passionate self-taught software developer, I have built several projects using the React library and vanilla JavaScript. My knowledge extends beyond the front-end, as I am familiar working with the back-end using Node.js with Express.js and handling SQL databases. My commitment to continuous learning and my ability to integrate both front-end and back-end technologies make me a valuable asset for any development team.",
        "Eager to learn, hardworking, and easy going, I thrive in collaborative environments.",
